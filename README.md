Repository for CSCE 315 class project

To use:

  1. Make sure all files are in your home drive (/home/ugrads/#/NetID)
  
  1a. If they are on your local files, you need to scp the files to your home drive. The command: scp C:\Users\name\filename.java NetID@unix.cse.tamu.edu:/home/ugrads/#/NetID)  
  
  1b. For postgresql-42.2.8.jar, you need to make a lib folder and put the file in there. So the file should be located in /home/ugrads/#/NetID/lib/
  
  2. Once all files are in the correct locations, type  java -cp .:lib/postgresql-42.2.8.jar jdbcpostgreSQL to run the files used. Note: Follow the instructions in this link to view the GUI https://uisapp2.iu.edu/confluence-prd/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=280461906
